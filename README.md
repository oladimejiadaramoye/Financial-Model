**Here is a financial model built from scratch to forecast the financial performance of a school based on varying inputs and assumptions.**
Step 1: I determined the specific objectives of the model. This was investment analysis and financial forecasting. This would form the basis of my conclusions
Step 2: I had to do market research to get data for assumtions as there were no historical data from the school, including income, expenses, enrollment numbers, fee structures, etc.
Step 3: I organize my Excel workbook with separate sheets for assumptions (inputs), and outputs; income, expenses, summary, etc.
Step 4: Listed all key assumptions like enrollment, tuition fee, etc.
Step 5: Used assumptions to project future revenues based on factors like student enrollment numbers and fee structure.
Step 6: i detailed all major expense categories (salaries, utilities, maintenance, etc.).
Step 7: Workings for, Capex, Opex, working capital, depreciation e.t.c.
Step 8: I developed integrated financial statements – Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement, ensuring they are interconnected; changes in revenue and expenses automatically update the balance sheet and cash flow statement.
Step 9: Did analysis with ratios and metrics relevant to school management, like profit margin, cost per student etc.
Step 10: Created a dashboard using Power BI (cleaner and visiualy appealing than Excel) for a quick overview of the school’s financial health.
